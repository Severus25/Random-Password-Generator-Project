# Random-Password-Generator-Project
In my Random Password Generator App, users can generate random passwords by customizing their preferred settings such as lowercase, uppercase, number, etc. There is also a password strength meter that indicates the strength of the userâ€™s generated password. And last, user can copy their generated password to the clipboard.
